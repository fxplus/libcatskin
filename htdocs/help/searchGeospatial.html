<p>WebVoyáge provides you with a variety of options when searching 
 for map-related items in your database. You can conduct a search for items 
 by specifying a region which must be covered, in part or in whole, by 
 the item. This region can be a rectangle, a polygon, a point or circle, 
 a corridor or route, or a range.</p>

<h2><a NAME=rectangleSearch></a>Rectangle Search</h2>

<p>The Rectangular Search function allows you to perform a search on a 
 rectangular area. To define the area, you must provide the lower-left 
 corner and the upper-right corner of the rectangle.</p>

<p>To perform a search on a rectangular area:</p>

<ol>
	
	<li >Click the <b>Rectangle Search</b> button. The 
 Rectangle Search tools appear on the screen..</li>
	
	<li >Enter whether you want your search to include 
 only the area covered by the map or the Minimum Bounding Rectangle (the 
 smallest rectangular area that would enclose the entire map) by selecting 
 <b>Polygon</b> or <b>MBR</b> from the <b>Shoe Size</b> drop-down list.</li>
	
	<li >Enter which units you want to use in order 
 to describe the coordinates by clicking on the <b>Format Type</b> drop-down 
 and selecting a type from the list. You can select <b>Degrees/Minutes/Seconds</b>; 
 <b>Degrees/Decimal Minutes</b>; <b>Decimal Degrees</b>; <b>UTM Meters</b>; 
 <b>MGRS</b>; or <b>UPS</b>.</li>
	
	<li >Enter the coordinates for the lower-left 
 point of the area into the field(s) in the Lower Left column. If you selected 
 units of Degrees/Minutes/Seconds, Degrees/Decimal Minutes, or Decimal 
 Degrees, you must enter a Latitude value and a Longitude value. If you 
 selected UTM Meters, MGRS, or UPS, you must enter the point into the field 
 in that format.</li>
	
	<li >Enter the coordinates for the upper-right 
 point of the area into the field(s) in the Upper-Right column. If you 
 selected units of Degrees/Minutes/Seconds, Degrees/Decimal Minutes, or 
 Decimal Degrees, you must enter a Latitude value and a Longitude value. 
 If you selected UTM Meters, MGRS, or UPS, you must enter the point into 
 the field in that format.</li>
	
	<li >Select how many records you want to appear 
 on each page of search results by clicking on the <b>Records per page</b> 
 drop-down and selecting a number from the list.</li>
	
	<li >Click the <b>Search</b> button to perform 
 the search; or click the <b>Clear</b> button to reset the fields on the 
 screen.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a NAME=polygonSearch></a>Polygon Search</h2>

<p>The Polygon Searching function allows you to perform a search on an 
 area that is not rectangular. You can enter up to ten points into the 
 list. The area that will be searched is created by connecting each coordinate 
 with the next in the order in which they were entered. (The first and 
 last coordinates are also connected together.)</p>

<p>For example, if you entered Latitude and Longitude information into 
 the fields Coordinate 1 through Coordinate 5, Coordinate 1 would be connected 
 with Coordinates 2 and 5; Coordinate 2 would be connected to Coordinates 
 1 and 3; and so on.</p>

<p>To perform a search on a polygonal area:</p>

<ol >
	
	<li>Click the <b>Polygon Search</b> button. The Polygon 
 Search tools appear on the screen..</li>
	
	<li >Enter whether you want your search to include 
 only the area covered by the map or the Minimum Bounding Rectangle (the 
 smallest rectangular area that would enclose the entire map) by selecting 
 <b>Polygon</b> or <b>MBR</b> from the <b>Shoe Size</b> drop-down list.</li>
	
	<li >Enter which units you want to use in order 
 to describe the coordinates by clicking on the <b>Format Type</b> drop-down 
 and selecting a type from the list. You can select <b>Degrees/Minutes/Seconds</b>; 
 <b>Degrees/Decimal Minutes</b>; <b>Decimal Degrees</b>; <b>UTM Meters</b>; 
 <b>MGRS</b>; or <b>UPS</b>.</li>
	
	<li>Enter the coordinates for each point of 
 the area to be searched (in the order that they are to be connected to 
 form the polygon; the last point in the list will be connected to the 
 first point in the list) into the Coordinate fields. If you selected units 
 of Degrees/Minutes/Seconds, Degrees/Decimal Minutes, or Decimal Degrees, 
 you must enter a Latitude value and a Longitude value for each coordinate. 
 If you selected UTM Meters, MGRS, or UPS, you must enter the coordinates 
 into the field in that format.</li>
	
	<li>Select how many records you want to appear 
 on each page of search results by clicking on the <b>Records per page</b> 
 drop-down and selecting a number from the list.</li>
	
	<li>Click the <b>Search</b> button to perform 
 the search; or click the <b>Clear</b> button to reset the fields on the 
 screen.</li>
</ol>


<h2><a NAME=radiusSearch></a>Point and Radius Search</h2>

<p>The Point and Radius Searching function allows you to perform a search 
 for a single point, or for a circular area centered around a point.</p>

<p>To perform a search on a circular area:</p>

<ol>
	
	<li>Click the <b>Point and Radius Search</b> button. 
 The Point and Radius Search tools appear on the screen..</li>
	
	<li>Enter whether you want your search to include 
 only the area covered by the map or the Minimum Bounding Rectangle (the 
 smallest rectangular area that would enclose the entire map) by selecting 
 <b>Polygon</b> or <b>MBR</b> from the <b>Shoe Size</b> drop-down list.</li>
	
	<li>Enter which units you want to use in order to 
 describe the coordinates by clicking on the <b>Format Type</b> drop-down 
 and selecting a type from the list. You can select <b>Degrees/Minutes/Seconds</b>; 
 <b>Degrees/Decimal Minutes</b>; <b>Decimal Degrees</b>; <b>UTM Meters</b>; 
 <b>MGRS</b>; or <b>UPS</b>.</li>
	
	<li>Enter the coordinates for the center point of 
 the circle into the field(s) in the Point and Radius block. If you selected 
 units of Degrees/Minutes/Seconds, Degrees/Decimal Minutes, or Decimal 
 Degrees, you must enter a Latitude value and a Longitude value. If you 
 selected UTM Meters, MGRS, or UPS, you must enter the point into the field 
 in that format.</li>
	
	<li>Enter the dimension of the radius of the circle 
 into the Radius field, and select a unit of measurement for the radius 
 from the Radius drop-down menu. Entering a Radius measurement is optional.</li>
	
	<li>Select how many records you want to appear on 
 each page of search results by clicking on the <b>Records per page</b> 
 drop-down and selecting a number from the list.</li>
	
	<li>Click the <b>Search</b> button to perform the 
 search; or click the <b>Clear</b> button to reset the fields on the screen.</li>
</ol>



<h2><a NAME=corridorSearch></a>Corridor/Route Search</h2>

<p>The Corridor/Route Searching function allows you to perform a search 
 on an area defined as a path along a series of points. You can enter up 
 to ten points into the list. The area that will be searched is created 
 by connecting each coordinate with the next in the order in which they 
 were entered, and then measuring tangentially away from each �leg� of 
 the path. (Unlike the Polygon Search, however, the first and last coordinates 
 are not connected together, and no interior range is searched.)</p>

<p>For example, if you entered Latitude and Longitude information into 
 the fields Coordinate 1 through Coordinate 6, Coordinate 1 would be connected 
 with Coordinate 2; Coordinate 2 would be connected to Coordinates 1 and 
 3; and so on.</p>

<p>To perform a search on a corridor or route:</p>

<ol>
	
	<li>Click the <b>Corridor/Route Search</b> button. 
 The Corridor/Route Search tools appear on the screen..</li>
	
	<li>Enter whether you want your search to include 
 only the area covered by the map or the Minimum Bounding Rectangle (the 
 smallest rectangular area that would enclose the entire map) by selecting 
 <b>Polygon</b> or <b>MBR</b> from the <b>Shoe Size</b> drop-down list.</li>
	
	<li>Enter which units you want to use in order 
 to describe the coordinates by clicking on the <b>Format Type</b> drop-down 
 and selecting a type from the list. You can select <b>Degrees/Minutes/Seconds</b>; 
 <b>Degrees/Decimal Minutes</b>; <b>Decimal Degrees</b>; <b>UTM Meters</b>; 
 <b>MGRS</b>; or <b>UPS</b>.</li>
	
	<li>Enter the coordinates for each point of 
 the route to be searched (in the order in which they are to be connected 
 to form the route; unlike the Polygon Search, however, the last point 
 in the list will not be connected to the first point in the list) into 
 the Coordinate fields. If you selected units of Degrees/Minutes/Seconds, 
 Degrees/Decimal Minutes, or Decimal Degrees, you must enter a Latitude 
 value and a Longitude value for each coordinate. If you selected UTM Meters, 
 MGRS, or UPS, you must enter the coordinates into the field in that format.</li>
	
	<li>Select how many records you want to appear 
 on each page of search results by clicking on the <b>Records per page</b> 
 drop-down and selecting a number from the list.</li>
	
	<li>Click the <b>Search</b> button to perform 
 the search; or click the <b>Clear</b> button to reset the fields on the 
 screen.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a NAME=rangeSearch></a>Range Search</h2>

<p>The Range Search function allows you to perform a search on a partially 
 bounded area. To define the area, you may provide any combination of upper, 
 lower, left and right coordinates. </p>

<p>To perform a search over a range:</p>

<ol>
	
	<li>Click the <b>Range Search</b> button. The Range 
 Search tools appear on the screen..</li>
	
	<li>Enter whether you want your search to include 
 only the area covered by the map or the Minimum Bounding Rectangle (the 
 smallest rectangular area that would enclose the entire map) by selecting 
 <b>Polygon</b> or <b>MBR</b> from the <b>Shoe Size</b> drop-down list.</li>
	
	<li>Enter which units you want to use in order 
 to describe the coordinates by clicking on the <b>Format Type</b> drop-down 
 and selecting a type from the list. You can select <b>Degrees/Minutes/Seconds</b>; 
 <b>Degrees/Decimal Minutes</b>; <b>Decimal Degrees</b>; <b>UTM Meters</b>; 
 <b>MGRS</b>; or <b>UPS</b>.</li>
	
	<li>Enter the coordinate for each limit of the 
 range into the field(s) in the Lower Left column. If you selected units 
 of Degrees/Minutes/Seconds, Degrees/Decimal Minutes, or Decimal Degrees, 
 you must enter a Latitude value and a Longitude value. If you selected 
 UTM Meters, MGRS, or UPS, you must enter the point into the field in that 
 format.</li>
	
	<li>Select how many records you want to appear 
 on each page of search results by clicking on the <b>Records per page</b> 
 drop-down and selecting a number from the list.</li>
	
	<li>Click the <b>Search</b> button to perform 
 the search; or click the <b>Clear</b> button to reset the fields on the
